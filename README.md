🪄 PPT-Generator: Your Text, Your Template, Instant Slides

Turn any text, notes, or markdown document into a beautifully styled PowerPoint presentation in seconds. This tool uses the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to intelligently structure your content into slides while inheriting the complete design—colors, fonts, and layouts—from your own .pptx or .potx template file.
✨ Core Features

    🎨 Inherit Your Design: Upload any .pptx or .potx file to serve as a template. The generated presentation will perfectly match your brand or personal style.

    🧠 Intelligent Content Structuring: An LLM analyzes your text and logically organizes it into titles, bullets, and speaker notes across multiple slides.

    🔌 Multi-Provider Support: Connect to your preferred LLM provider.

        OpenAI (GPT-4o, etc.)

        Anthropic (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, etc.)

        Google (Gemini 1.5 Pro, etc.)

        Perplexity (Sonar models)

        AI-Pipe (Universal proxy)

    🖼️ Smart Image Reuse: Automatically reuses images from your template to add visual interest to the new slides.

    🔬 Live Preview: Instantly preview the slide-by-slide plan generated by the LLM before you build the final .pptx file.

    🔒 Privacy First: Your API keys and input text are never stored. All processing happens in-memory.

    🚀 Deploy Anywhere: Comes ready with a Procfile for one-click deployment to services like Render or Railway.

⚙️ How It Works

    ✍️ Add Content: Paste your text or markdown into the app.

    🎨 Upload Template: Provide a .pptx or .potx file to use as the design base.

    🤖 Connect LLM: Choose your LLM provider and enter your API key.

    🪄 Generate: Click "Generate .pptx". The app asks the LLM to create a slide plan and then builds the presentation using your template's styles.

    📥 Download: Your new, fully-styled presentation is ready to download instantly.
